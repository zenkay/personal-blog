<h4>Official Web Site</h4>

You can find more information on our web site (<a href="http://www.wpfastestcache.com/">wpfastestcache.com</a>)

This plugin creates static html files from your dynamic WordPress blog.
When a page is rendered, php and mysql are used. Therefore, system needs RAM and CPU. 
If many visitors come to a site, system uses lots of RAM and CPU so page is rendered so slowly. 
In this case, you need a cache system not to render page again and again.
Cache system generates a static html file and saves. Other users reach to static html page.
<br><br>
Setup of this plugin is so easy. You don't need to modify the .htacces file. It will be modified automatically.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I know my blog is being cached? =
You need to refresh a page twice. If a page is cached, at the bottom of the page there is a text like "&lt;!-- WP Fastest Cache file was created in 0.330816984177 seconds, on 08-01-14 9:01:35 --&gt;".

= Does it work with Nginx? =
No, it does not work with Nginx.

= Does it work with IIS (Windows Server) ? =
No, it does not work with IIS.

= What does ".htaccess not found" warning mean? =
Wpfc does not create .htaccess automatically so you need to create empty one.

= How is "tmpWpfc" removed? =
When the cached files are deleted, they are moved to "tmpWpfc" instead of being deleted and a cron-job is set. Delete all files are so difficult for server so cron-job is set not to use a lot of CPU resources. Cron-job is set and it deletes 100 files every 5 minutes. When all files in "tmpWpfc" are deleted, cron-job is unset.

= How can stop caching for some pages? =
If you add &lt;!--[wpfcNOT]--&gt; into source coude, creating cache stops. You can find it on visual and text editor after opening Add New Post panel.

= Does Wpfc work with WPMU (Wordpress Multisite) properly? =
No. Wpfc does not support Wordpress Multisite yet.

= Does Wpfc work in "Subdirectory Install"? =
Yes. Wpfc supports "Subdirectory Install".

= Is this plugin compatible with CloudFlare? =
Yes, it is compatible with CloudFlare 100%. If the "minify html" option is active on CloudFlare, the minify system removed the comment from html so you cannot see the comment of Wpfc at the bottom of the page and you cannot be sure that it works or not. In this case, you need to look at the style files. You can see the minified css files.

Yes, it is compatible with Bulletproof Security 100%.
