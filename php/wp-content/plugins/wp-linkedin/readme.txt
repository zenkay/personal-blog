== Description ==

This plugin provides you with shortcodes to insert your full LinkedIn profile
and a rotating scroller of your LinkedIn recommendations in any Wordpress page
or post. Please check <a href="http://vedovini.net/">vedovini.net</a> for
examples.

The following shortcodes are available:

* `[li_recommendations width="480" length="200" interval="1000"]` displays a
rotating scroller with the recommendations you received
* `[li_profile]` displays your LinkedIn profile. Optional attributes
are `fields` and `lang` to overide the general settings.
* `[li_card]` displays a simple LinkedIn card. Optional attributes
are `picture_width` and `summary_length`, and `fields` and `lang` to overide
the general settings.
* `[li_updates]` displays your network updates. Optional attributes are `count`
and `only_self`.
* `[li_picture]` displays the original profile picture (size may vary depending
on what you uploaded to LinkedIn). Optional attributes are `width`, `height`
and `class`.

To customize the rendering of the shortcodes you must create a `linkedin` folder
in your theme and then copy the template file you want to modify.
The default template files are located in the plugin's `templates` folder.

See this post for more details on customization: [Showing more of your LinkedIn
profile with WP-LinkedIn](http://vedovini.net/more-wp-linkedin)

There are also several widgets. One widget displays the recommendations
scroller, one displays your network updates, and two widgets show a "profile
card" - one of which is the standard LinkedIn JavaScript profile widget, the
other uses a customizable template.

**ATTENTION:** Since v1.6 the call to add the javascript for the recommendations
slider to the page as been moved to the `recommendations.php` template. If you
customized that template you must add the following line to the top of your
custom template: `wp_enqueue_script('responsive-scrollable');`

We welcome volunteers to translate that plugin into more languages. If you wish
to help then contact [@cvedovini](https://twitter.com/cvedovini) on Twitter or
use that [contact form](http://vedovini.net/contact/).

Please check the [WP-LinkedIn Multi-Users](http://vedovini.net/downloads/wp-linkedin-multi-users/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=wp-linkedin)
extension if you need to show the profiles of multiple users.

And if you need to show company profiles or company updates, please check the
[WP-LinkedIn for Companies](http://vedovini.net/downloads/wp-linkedin-co/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=wp-linkedin)
extension.


== Installation ==

This plugin follows the [standard WordPress installation
method](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins):

1. Upload the `wp-linkedin` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Create a LinkedIn API key/secret pair and register the redirect URI (follow
the instructions on the settings page)
1. Generate an access token for the LinkedIn API (those tokens expire after 60
days so you will have to regenerate them from time to time)
1. The `Profile fields` field is the list of fields that will be available to
the profile template for rendering - see this post for more details on
customization: [Showing more of your LinkedIn profile with
WP-LinkedIn](http://vedovini.net/more-wp-linkedin)


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin support multiple user profiles? =

No, it doesn't. But there is a premiun extension,
[WP-LinkedIn Multi-Users](http://vedovini.net/downloads/wp-linkedin-multi-users/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=wp-linkedin)
that changes the behavior of this plugin so that shortcodes and widgets show
the data of the author of the post or page.

= Does the plugin support company profiles? =

No, it doesn't. But there is a premiun extension,
[WP-LinkedIn for Companies](http://vedovini.net/downloads/wp-linkedin-co/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=wp-linkedin)
that provides shortcodes and widgets for company profiles and company updates.

= How to add the volunteer experiences section from my profile? =

The volunteer experiences section is already in the template but is not
activated by default. To activate it you must add the relevant profile fields
to the list of fields, the minimum is `volunteer`. To get the full data
use this:

`volunteer:(volunteer-experiences:(organization,cause,role,start-date,
end-date,description))`

= How to add the projects section to my profile? =

The projects section is already in the template but is not activated by default.
To activate it you must add the relevant profile fields to the list of fields:

`projects:(name,url,start-date,end-date,members:(name,
person:(public-profile-url,first-name,last-name,picture-url,headline)),
description)`

= How to add the publications section to my profile? =

The publications section is already in the template but is not activated by
default. To activate it you must add the relevant profile fields to the list
of fields:

`publications:(title,publisher,authors,date,url,summary)`

= How to add the honors & awards section to my profile? =

The honors & awards section is already in the template but is not activated by
default. To activate it you must add the relevant profile fields to the list
of fields:

`honors-awards:(name,issuer,date,description)`

= How to add other sections to my profile? =

For other sections see [Showing more of your LinkedIn profile with
WP-LinkedIn](http://vedovini.net/more-wp-linkedin).

= I have a slider somewhere and it doesn't work anymore when I add the recommendations' scroller =

It's usually due to an incompatibility between the different javascript
components used. To solve the incompatibility it's better to choose one of the
component and use only this one. To change the component that is used by the
recommendations' scroller you will need to customize the `recommendations.php`
template.

= I am constantly asked to get a new access token =

There can be several reasons to that problem, check the following:

- Make sure your server's time is correct.
- If you are using an external cache system make sure it's properly configured.
- Try to uncheck the `Verify SSL peer` option on the plugin's settings page.

= Since I updated to v1.6 the recommendation slider does not work anymore =

Since v1.6 the call to add the javascript for the recommendations slider to
the page as been moved to the `recommendations.php` template. If you
customized that template you must add the following line to the top of your
custom template: `wp_enqueue_script('responsive-scrollable');`

= The updates shortcode (or the updates widget) doesn't show anything =

Try regenerating the access token from the settings page, the plugin needs new
authorization to access your network updates.

= Profile picture is only 80x80 pixels is there a way to get a bigger one from LinkedIn? =

You can either add `picture-urls::(original)` to the list of fields and output
that field in a customized template or use the `[li_picture]` shortcode.


== Screenshots ==

1. The recommendation shortcode in action (note that the CSS is customized in
that example).
2. Full page using the profile shortcode and displaying the LinkedIn full
profile.
3. LinkedIn profile card added after a post content.


== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.18 =

token has changed in this version. You must update the redirect urls setting
in you LinkedIn API Application details. See the plugin settings page, API
access section, for more.

= 1.14 =
As of April 11, 2014 LinkedIn requires that redirect uris be registered, thus
forcing every plugin installation to have its own application key/secret pair
and register the corresponding redirect uri. Follow the instructions on the
plugin settings page.

the `wp-config.php` file and debug information will be printed by the plugin as
