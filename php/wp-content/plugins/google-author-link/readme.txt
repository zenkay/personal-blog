Manage your Google Authorship Links with this simple plugin. Works for single author and multi-author WordPress sites.

== Description ==

Use Google plus and want to easily control your Google Authorship?

This plugin works for single user WordPress sites and multi-author sites. Each user has a new field to store their Google Profile URL, then on each page and post the plugin will create the required link in the HTML Head.

There is also an option to set the author for your WordPress home page.

All you then have to do is add your WordPress site to your Google Profile.

** New in version 1.5 **

We've added a tool in the plugin's setting page to test your pages and posts directly in Google's Rich Snippet tool

** New in version 1.4.1 and above **

Controls to allow you to hide authorship from some or all of your WordPress pages.

** New in version 1.3 and above **

Controls to allow you to select categories and custom post types that shouldn't contain your authorship code.

** New in version 1.2 and above **

Google Author Link now supports Company / Brand profiles in Google with the new Publisher Profile, the ability to link your whole site with your Google + Page.
