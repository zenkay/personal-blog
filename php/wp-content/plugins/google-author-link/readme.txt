== Description ==

This plugin works for single user WordPress sites and multi-author sites. Each user has a new field to store their Google Profile URL, then on each page and post the plugin will create the required link in the HTML Head.

There is also an option to set the author for your WordPress home page.

All you then have to do is add your WordPress site to your Google Profile.
