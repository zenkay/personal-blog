WP Twitter Cards adds meta data to your WordPress site that will create Twitter cards when your site is shared on Twitter

== Description ==

WP Twitter Cards lets you easily add meta data to your whole site. 

WP Twitter Cards adds an additional meta box to the post and page editing screen 
for you to enter Twitter card meta values for that post or page.

When a link to the site is tweeted Twitter will create a card with the title,
description and url along with any multi-media that you have specified.

= Usage =

Once you have entered your Twitter username into the settings page you may also
additionally add a default title, description and image. These can all be overwritten
on a per page / post basis.

Each post / page will have its own meta box for entering title, description, image
card type etc. If you leave these blank the default settings will be used in their
place.

Categories card data is generated from the category name and description.
