The Best Way to Add Twitter Cards Metadata in WordPress Site. Enable Summary and Photo Cards Easily, With Control.

== Description ==

[WPDeveloper.net](http://wpdeveloper.net/) brings 'Twitter Cards Meta' for all WordPress user for free. Adding Twitter Cards meta was never this easy. 100% validate meta according to Twitter and get sure approval. Now supports Photo & Summary Cards, Player Card support coming soon.

[Twitter Cards](http://wpdeveloper.net/free-plugin/twitter-cards-meta/) increase your Twitter visibility & Brand value. And with this plugin you don't have to worry about the markup, because its very important to get the markup correct, otherwise Twitter will not accept your application.

Please read Twitter Cards' detail [guideline and terms](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) before proceed.

Though there are other possible ways to add Twitter Cards metadata but this plugin is the best and easiest way for Twitter Cards. We have reasons to believe so, we will explain that at the bottom of this page. Check our feature first.

**Feature Includes:**

*   Auto Add Twitter Cards Meta Tags in every single posts/pages
*   For multi-author blog this plugin could add a extra field in 'Author Bio/Profile' page to add his own Twitter Account.
*   Ability to get Attachment image automatically.
*   This plugin will get the first used image, even if WordPress attachment image did not work properly.
*   Ability to assign image from custom field, you could just type which custom field have the best image for this purpose.
*   Possible to add Twitter Cards meta tags even in Home Page.
*   You could include a custom Description for Home Page.
*   Though its not a good practice but you could include a default Image, its specially helpful for home page.
*   **New** Photo Card Support Added.
*   **New** Ability to select 'Card Type' per post basis or site-wide.
*   **New** Meta Box in post panel to select individual post's 'Card Type'.
*   **New** Option to force all posts (old and future posts) to a certain 'Cards Type'. It will override individual post's selection. 
*   **New** Now Attached and Featured image both work properly and user have the option to select which type of image he wants.

**Why Twitter Cards Meta is The Best Solution?**

You could say there are other process like adding codes manually in your theme header, or using famous SEO plugins like "WordPress SEO by Yoast" or other plugin that claim to serve same like this plugin, but why we are the best? Here is our point -

*   None other solution works perfectly with image. All other plugins only depend on WordPress Attachment. But from our years of experience we have seen image attachment does not work for most of the sites and themes.
*   Only this plugin will pick image automatically from your post, even its not attached properly. 
*   Other plugin will mostly use your default image as they cant grab image properly, even "WordPress SEO by Yoast" does the same. But please read the Twitter Cards' [guideline and terms](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) guideline about image. It clearly says 'Do not use a generic image such as your website logo, author photo, or other image that spans multiple pages.' So if you end up using default image for most posts, you will probably never get approved in Twitter Cards.
*   This plugin does the markup in right way, and in right position.
*   **New** Only this plugin handles both 'Summary Card' and 'Photo Card' properly.
*   **New** Only this plugin has the option to select Twitter 'Card Type' per post basis, right from post panel.

The main thing is, we had to make this plugin as other solution did not worked for most of our projects. So we have learned from others' limitation, and we come-up with better solution. We have already added Photo Card and will add Player Card support very soon.

"*...Yoast isn't really a fully functional implementation of the Twitter Card standard. To my knowledge, it doesn't take into account, for example, pictures or videos... And the plugin that's best to use it called Twitter Cards Meta by WPdeveloper. The plugin couldn't be easier. Install it and just fill out a few fields and that's it.*"
